                system property?<ul id="ul_pyk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>No. This is one of the recommended ways to protect against the
                        vulnerability.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Am I still vulnerable if I set the environment variable:

                    <li>No. This may be the easier way to protect against this vulnerability. It can
                        be set server-wide to protect all applications using Log4j. It can also be
                        set for entire kubernetes clusters using kubectl set env.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Am I still vulnerable if I block all outbound traffic?<ul id="ul_uyk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>If you block ALL the outbound traffic, you may be safe, but:<ul
                            id="ul_vyk_czp_xrb">
                            <li>be sure to block also DNS traffic as it can exfiltrate data such as
                                environment variables</li>
                            <li>be sure to re-assess which servers are trusted - maybe some trusted
                                servers had the same vulnerability and were exploited</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>Either way, it is a very good idea to restrict outbound traffic from Oxygen
                        tools. This will protect you against various types of vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Am I still vulnerable if I use a new version of Java?<ul id="ul_zyk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>The vulnerability is know to exist with the latest versions of Java (e.g. >
                        1.8u191) if you are also using <xref

                        are not using those servers, you may still be vulnerable, but we are not
                        aware of any exploit.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Should I remove the JndiLookup class?<ul id="ul_azk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>Removing it will remove the vulnerable code. We have high confidence that
                        other problems will not be generated.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Am I still vulnerable if I use an old version of Oxygen?<ul id="ul_bzk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>Before version 22.1, Oxygen products shipped with an older version of Log4j.
                        We updated log4j since then also because of some security
                        vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Should I set firewall rules based on HTTP headers or URLs to block attacks?<ul
                    id="ul_czk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>This kind of rules do not offer full protection. The URLs that exploit the
                        vulnerability can be written in various ways and are not recognized by
                        common WAF rules that you might find.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>How to test if I am vulnerable?<ul id="ul_dzk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>You are.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Should I do anything if the affected server is deployed inside the intranet?<ul
                    id="ul_ezk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>Yes. The attack can be triggered from another server that was exploited or
                        by one of the employees when they follow a link in a phishing email.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Should I upgrade to the latest version of your products?<ul id="ul_jzk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>Yes. New maintenance builds that avoid this vulnerability are available for
                        versions that are in the maintenance period.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>Is this vulnerability related to Java being insecure?<ul id="ul_kzk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>No. It is caused by an open-source component called log4j which had a
                        vulnerability. This component is widely used in the Java ecosystem.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>How is Syncro Soft addressing the problem:<ul id="ul_lzk_czp_xrb">
                    <li>We patched all our public servers against this vulnerability.</li>
                    <li>We provided a security advisory with current solutions <xref

                        and we are working to produce maintenance builds that remove the vulnerable
                        version of log4j.</li>
                    <li>We analyzed and updated our internal servers to make sure they are not
                        vulnerable.</li>
                    <li>We scanned the logs of the services we use or provide to look for the
                        pattern that triggers the vulnerability.</li>
